#CreateProject
Starting a new project is always the same:

* Create a main file
* Create a README
* Think of how your tools should be configured
* ...

... and it's horrible to start with an empty file staring at you.

This little tool creates the basic stuff you need to start a new
python project, a runnable main.py, a README.md and a config.ini.

No need to start from zero, just fill in the real code and forget
the hassle with basic stuff ;)

##Module dependencies

You need to _pip install _:

* configobj

##Usage

It's just two simple steps:

1. Enter your data in the config.ini (of this tool ;)
2. _python createproject.py your-projects-name_

Yes, you're done! Start writing your code, and don't forget to
edit your project's README.md!
